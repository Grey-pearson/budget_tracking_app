Budgeting App
---
my goal is to be able to create a google sheets file in a format similar to this
|     |  A   |      B      |   C   |
|:---:|:----:|:-----------:|:-----:|
| 1   | 2/23 | groceries   | $1600 |
| 2   | 2/29 | rent        | $1992 |
| 3   | 3/4  | video_games | $999  |

and have the app spit out graphs and charts catogorizing
each expense into catogories
and compaire multiple months based off of the dates
and make it a file to save to compare visally in the future
